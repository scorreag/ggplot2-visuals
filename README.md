# ggplot2-visuals
Some visuals built suing ggplot2 in R

This code was writen as part of an academic project that consisted in using machine learning techniques to predict the ratings of movies based on relavant variables. This repository contains only the code used to build the visuals of that project. I wrote this code when I was learning to R, so it is a bit messy. 

The following tutorial was used to build the correlation matrices:

The code can be reproduced using the csv files attached.
